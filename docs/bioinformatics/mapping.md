# Aligning reads

Aligning short reads from next-generation sequencing platforms such as Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to a reference genome is an essential step in the data analysis pipeline for several compelling reasons. Firstly, ONT generates millions of reads, typically around XXX to XXX base pairs in length, making them challenging to interpret individually. By aligning these reads to a reference genome, we can accurately map each read's origin and reconstruct the underlying genomic sequence. This process enables the detection of genetic variations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants, aiding in the understanding of genetic diversity and finding important mutations such as those that casue resistance.

Additionally, alignment to a reference genome facilitates gene expression analysis, identifying regions of the genome actively transcribed and contributing to the characterization of various biological processes. Ultimately, aligning short reads to a reference genome is critical for interpreting NGS data, unlocking valuable insights into the genetic basis of diseases, evolutionary relationships, and other genomic phenomena.
