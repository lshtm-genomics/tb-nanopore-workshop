# The data

## Background

We have provided you with sequencing data from 4 samples that were collected in Portugal from individuals with MDR-TB and XDR-TB and were sequenced using the minION as part of an evaluating of the technology to detect resistance[^1]. The samples were also tested using for drug resistance using phenotypic methods[^2]. 

!!! info "Drug susceptibility testing"
    All clinical samples were prepared by inoculating a single colony into Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% OADC (Becton Dickinson). Susceptibility testing for the first-line anti-TB drugs rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (ETB), pyrazinamide (PZA) and streptomycin (STR) and the second-line drugs rifabutin (RFB), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CAP), ofloxacin (OFX), moxifloxacin (MOX), ethionamide (ETH), para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and linezolid (LZ) was performed on all strains with the MGIT960 system (Becton Dickinson), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative drug susceptibility testing (qDST) for both first- and second-line drugs was conducted using a combination of the MGIT960 system and the Epicenter V5.80A software equipped with the TB eXIST module (Becton Dickinson)
